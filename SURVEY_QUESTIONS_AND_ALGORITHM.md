## üìù Survey Questions Overview

The survey consists of **10 questions** that collect information about:
- AI knowledge and experience
- Coding/programming background
- Learning preferences and goals
- Industry context
- Mindset and motivations

---

## ‚ùì Question 1: AI Knowledge Level

**Question:** "How would you describe your current understanding of AI?"

**Type:** Single choice

**Options:**
1. Complete beginner - I know very little about AI
2. Basic awareness - I have heard of AI but haven't used it much
3. Intermediate - I use AI tools regularly
4. Advanced - I understand ML concepts and have built AI solutions
5. Expert - I work professionally with AI/ML technologies

### Algorithm Usage

**Primary Function:** Calculates the **AI Score** (0-100 scale)

**Mapping:**
```typescript
const knowledgeMap = {
  'Complete beginner - I know very little about AI': 10,
  'Basic awareness - I have heard of AI but haven't used it much': 30,
  'Intermediate - I use AI tools regularly': 50,
  'Advanced - I understand ML concepts and have built AI solutions': 75,
  'Expert - I work professionally with AI/ML technologies': 95
}
```

**How It's Used:**
- **Course Outline Generation:**
  - Determines technical level categorization:
    - `aiScore < 30`: "beginner-friendly"
    - `aiScore < 50`: "introductory to intermediate"
    - `aiScore < 75`: "intermediate to advanced"
    - `aiScore >= 75`: "advanced and technical"
  
- **Chapter Generation:**
  - Adjusts content complexity and jargon:
    - `< 30`: "very beginner-friendly, avoiding jargon"
    - `< 50`: "introductory to intermediate"
    - `< 75`: "intermediate to advanced"
    - `>= 75`: "advanced and technical"

- **Impact:** This is the **most critical metric** for personalization. It directly controls vocabulary, depth, and prerequisite assumptions throughout the course.

## ‚ùì Question 2: Coding Experience

**Question:** "What is your coding/programming experience?"

**Type:** Single choice

**Options:**
1. No coding experience
2. Basic scripting (Excel, simple automation)
3. Some programming knowledge (Python, JavaScript basics)
4. Proficient programmer (can build applications)
5. Expert developer (professional software engineering)

### Algorithm Usage

**Primary Function:** Determines coding experience level in the user profile

**Mapping:**
```typescript
const codingMap = {
  'No coding experience': 'no-code',
  'Basic scripting (Excel, simple automation)': 'basic',
  'Some programming knowledge (Python, JavaScript basics)': 'intermediate',
  'Proficient programmer (can build applications)': 'proficient',
  'Expert developer (professional software engineering)': 'expert'
}
```

**How It's Used:**
- **Stored in Profile:** `codingExperience` field
- **Content Adaptation:**
  - For `no-code` and `basic`: Content avoids code-heavy examples, focuses on no-code AI tools
  - For `intermediate` and above: Content includes coding examples, API usage, frameworks
- **Exercises:** Determines whether "Try It Yourself" exercises include coding tasks or focus on tool usage only

## ‚ùì Question 3: AI Tools Used

**Question:** "Which AI tools have you used? (Select all that apply)"

**Type:** Multiple choice

**Options:**
1. ChatGPT / Claude / Gemini
2. GitHub Copilot
3. Midjourney / DALL-E / Stable Diffusion
4. LangChain / LlamaIndex
5. Hugging Face models
6. OpenAI API / Anthropic API
7. None of the above

### Algorithm Usage

**Primary Function:** Tracks user's existing AI tool familiarity

**Mapping:**
- Stored as an array in `aiToolsUsed` field
- Passed directly to the AI model in the user profile

**How It's Used:**
- **Content Relevance:**
  - If user has used tools like ChatGPT/Claude: Content assumes familiarity with basic prompting
  - If user has used APIs: Content can reference API concepts without explanation
  - If user has used LangChain/LlamaIndex: Content can build on framework knowledge
  - If "None of the above": Content starts from absolute basics, introduces tools step-by-step

- **Tool Walkthroughs:**
  - Early chapters (1-5) include tool walkthroughs
  - Tools mentioned are prioritized based on user's existing experience
  - New tools are introduced more gradually if user hasn't used any

- **Example Selection:**
  - Examples reference tools the user has already encountered
  - New tools are introduced in contexts that relate to familiar tools

- Stored in both `learningFocus` and `goals` arrays
- Passed directly to AI prompts

**How It's Used:**
- **Course Outline Generation:**
  - Goals are included in the prompt: `Goals: ${profile.goals.join(', ')}`
  - AI uses this to prioritize chapter topics:
    - "Understand concepts" ‚Üí More foundational/theoretical chapters
    - "Use tools for productivity" ‚Üí More practical, tool-focused chapters
    - "Build applications" ‚Üí Technical implementation chapters
    - "Lead initiatives" ‚Üí Strategy and leadership-focused chapters
    - "Research cutting-edge" ‚Üí Advanced and emerging topic chapters
    - "Apply to industry" ‚Üí Industry-specific use cases woven throughout

- **Chapter Content:**
  - Each chapter's examples, exercises, and content align with stated goals
  - Technical depth adjusted based on goals (e.g., "build applications" gets more code)

- **Content Emphasis:**
  - Multiple goals allow for a balanced curriculum
  - Single-focused goals result in more specialized course structure

  'Visual (diagrams, videos, infographics)': 'visual',
  'Reading (articles, documentation)': 'text',
  'Hands-on (coding, experiments, projects)': 'hands-on',
  'Mixed approach': 'mixed'
}
```

**How It's Used:**
- **Stored in Profile:** `learningStyle` field (`'visual' | 'text' | 'hands-on' | 'mixed'`)

- **Chapter Content Adaptation:**
  - Included in chapter generation prompt: `Learning Style: ${profile.learningStyle}`
  - **Visual learners:** Content includes structured markdown formatting, clear headers, visual descriptions, encourages diagram creation
  - **Text learners:** Content is text-heavy, well-structured documentation style, comprehensive explanations
  - **Hands-on learners:** More exercises, code examples, "Try It Yourself" sections are more extensive, tool walkthroughs are step-by-step
  - **Mixed approach:** Balanced combination of all formats

- **Exercise Design:**
  - Visual: Exercises may include "create a diagram" or "visualize this concept"
  - Hands-on: More coding/practical exercises
  - Text: Reading assignments, documentation exploration

## ‚ùì Question 6: Time Commitment

**Question:** "How much time can you dedicate to learning?"

**Type:** Single choice

**Options:**
1. 1-2 hours per week
2. 3-5 hours per week
3. 6-10 hours per week
4. 10+ hours per week

### Algorithm Usage

**Primary Function:** Sets expectations for content length and pacing

**Mapping:**
- Stored directly as string in `timeCommitment` field
- Default: `'3-5 hours per week'` if not provided

**How It's Used:**
- **Content Length:**
  - Lower time commitment (1-2 hours): Chapters are shorter, more focused, less dense
  - Higher time commitment (10+ hours): Chapters can be longer, more comprehensive, include more exercises
  
- **Chapter Count:**
  - Currently fixed at 3 (dev) or 10 (production) chapters
  - Could be dynamically adjusted based on time commitment in future iterations

- **Exercise Volume:**
  - Lower commitment: Fewer, more essential exercises
  - Higher commitment: More extensive exercise sets, optional deep-dives

## ‚ùì Question 7: Technical Depth Preference

**Question:** "How technical do you want your learning to be?"

**Type:** Scale (1-5)

**Scale Labels:**
- **Min (1):** "Conceptual only"
- **Max (5):** "Deep technical"

### Algorithm Usage

**Primary Function:** Fine-tunes technical complexity beyond AI score

**Mapping:**
- Stored as number (1-5) in answers
- Currently stored but **not actively used** in the current implementation

**Potential Usage (Future Enhancement):**
- Could override or fine-tune the AI score-based technical level
- A high AI score (75) with low technical preference (1-2) might result in conceptual focus despite expertise
- A low AI score (30) with high technical preference (4-5) might introduce more technical depth earlier

**Current Status:** 
- ‚úÖ Collected in survey
