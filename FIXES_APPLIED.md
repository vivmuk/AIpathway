# âœ… Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Syntax Error in Quiz.tsx
**Problem:** Apostrophes in strings (like "I've", "haven't") were breaking TypeScript parser  
**Solution:** Changed from `I've` to `I have` and `havent` to avoid apostrophe issues  
**Files Changed:** `src/components/Quiz.tsx`

### 2. Missing Tailwind Typography Plugin
**Problem:** `prose` class not found in globals.css  
**Solution:** Installed `@tailwindcss/typography` plugin and added to tailwind.config.js  
**Files Changed:** 
- `package.json` (new dependency)
- `tailwind.config.js` (added plugin)

### 3. TypeScript Undefined Check
**Problem:** `question.scaleRange` possibly undefined error  
**Solution:** Added proper null checks and non-null assertions  
**Files Changed:** `src/components/Quiz.tsx`
