# üêô GitHub Setup & Push Instructions

## Quick Start (Command Line)

### If this is your first time pushing to this repo:

```bash
# 1. Make sure you're in the project directory
cd "C:\Users\vivga\OneDrive\AI\AI Projects\Personalized Learning"

# 2. Initialize git (if not already done)
git init

# 3. Add all files
git add .

# 4. Commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: AIPathway with industry & AI mindset features"

# 5. Add your remote (the GitHub repo)
git remote add origin https://github.com/vivmuk/AIpathway.git

# 6. Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### If you get an error about branch name:

Some systems default to `master` instead of `main`:

```bash
# Rename branch to main
git branch -M main

# Then push
git push -u origin main
```

---

## Updating Your Code (After Initial Push)

```bash
# 1. Add changed files
git add .

# 2. Commit with a descriptive message
git commit -m "Add industry customization and AI growth mindset integration"

# 3. Push to GitHub
git push
```

## What Gets Pushed?

Your `.gitignore` file ensures these are **NOT** pushed:
- `node_modules/` (dependencies)
- `.next/` (build output)
- `.env.local` (your local API keys)

These **ARE** pushed:
- Source code (`src/`)
- Configuration files
- Documentation (`.md` files)
- `.env.example` (template without real keys)

---

## Verify Your Push

After pushing, visit:
https://github.com/vivmuk/AIpathway

You should see all your files there!

## Common Git Commands

```bash
# Check status (what's changed)
git status

# See commit history
git log --oneline

# Undo last commit (keeps changes)
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# Discard local changes
git checkout -- <filename>

# Pull latest from GitHub
git pull origin main
```

---

## Git Troubleshooting

### Error: "remote origin already exists"

```bash
# Remove old remote
git remote remove origin

# Add correct remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/vivmuk/AIpathway.git
```

### Error: "Updates were rejected"

```bash
# Pull first, then push
git pull origin main --rebase
git push
```

### Authentication Issues

GitHub now requires Personal Access Tokens (PAT) instead of passwords.

**Generate a token**:
1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Check "repo" scope
4. Copy token (you won't see it again!)
5. Use token as password when pushing

**Or use GitHub CLI**:
```bash
# Install GitHub CLI
winget install --id GitHub.cli

# Authenticate
gh auth login

# Push normally
git push
```

---

## Best Practices

1. **Commit often** with clear messages:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Fix: Markdown rendering in HTML export"
   git commit -m "Feature: Add industry customization to quiz"
   git commit -m "Update: Improve AI mindset prompts"
   ```

2. **Pull before push** if working across machines:
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   git push
   ```

3. **Check status before committing**:
   ```bash
   git status
   git diff  # See what changed
   ```

4. **Use `.gitignore`** to avoid pushing sensitive files

---

## GitHub Desktop (Alternative to Command Line)

If you prefer a GUI:

1. Download: https://desktop.github.com/
2. Install and sign in
3. File ‚Üí Add Local Repository ‚Üí Select your project folder
4. Stage changes (checkboxes)
5. Write commit message
6. Click "Commit to main"
7. Click "Push origin"

---

## Next Steps After Pushing

1. ‚úÖ Verify files on GitHub: https://github.com/vivmuk/AIpathway
2. üöÄ Deploy to Netlify (see `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`)
3. üîó Share your repo with collaborators
